- webapp_standalone : an xemple of what we are trying to achieve. works only on windows, we re trying to get the same crossplatform, and more with more complete web server ( Zend PHP xdebug -> REST development is the goal )
- win32 : tools for win32 platform. for now xampp and chromium
- linux : tools for linux platform. for now xampp and chromium

This folder will contain all config files necessary for crossplatform setup and run of a web server and independant instances of web browser.

It will be pulled as external by all webapp / website projects that want to be selfcontained and not require heavy setup from the developer.
